-------------------------------------------------
. Code for All Data Types in JavaScript:
JavaScript has several data types, including:

Primitive Data Types:

String
Number
Boolean
Null
Undefined
Symbol (introduced in ECMAScript 6)
Reference Data Types:

Object
Array
Function
Here's an example code snippet demonstrating the use of these data types:

// Primitive Data Types
let str = "Hello, World!"; // String
let num = 42;             // Number
let bool = true;           // Boolean
let nul = null;            // Null
let undef;                 // Undefined

// Symbol
const sym = Symbol('uniqueSymbol');

// Reference Data Types
let obj = { key: 'value' }; // Object
let arr = [1, 2, 3];         // Array
function exampleFunc() {     // Function
  // Function body
}

-----------------------------------------------
2. Uses of JavaScript Operators:
JavaScript operators perform operations on variables and values. They can be categorized into various types:

Arithmetic Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
Assignment Operators
Bitwise Operators
Unary Operators
Ternary (Conditional) Operator

-------------------------------------------------
3. Assignment Operator:
The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. For example:
let x = 10; // Assigning the value 10 to variable x

-------------------------------------------------
4. Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations. Here are some examples:

let a = 5;
let b = 2;

let sum = a + b;    // Addition
let diff = a - b;   // Subtraction
let product = a * b; // Multiplication
let quotient = a / b;// Division
let remainder = a % b;// Modulus (remainder of division)

-------------------------------------------------
5. Binary Operators in JavaScript:
Binary operators work with two operands.
 Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /),
  comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==), logical operators (&&, ||), etc.


-------------------------------------------------
6. Pre-Increment and Post-Increment in JavaScript:
Pre-increment (++i) and post-increment (i++) operators are used to increase the value of a variable by 1.
The difference lies in when the increment operation takes place:

Pre-increment: Increments the value before the variable is used in an expression.

let i = 5;
let preIncrement = ++i; // i is incremented before it's used
console.log(preIncrement); // Output: 6

Post-increment: Uses the current value of the variable in an expression and then increments the variable.
let j = 5;
let postIncrement = j++; // j is used, and then incremented
console.log(postIncrement); // Output: 5
console.log(j); // Output: 6
