1.1 Write a function `printOriginalArray` to print the original array, `numbersArray`, to the console.

1.2 Create a function named `divideNumbersByThree` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array with each number divided by 3. Call the function with `numbersArray` and print the divided array to the console.

1.3 Create a function named `findNumInArray` that takes an array of numbers and a `searchNum` as input and returns true if the `searchNum` is present in array. Call the function with `numbersArray`  with `searchNum as 24` and print the result to the console.

1.4 Create a function named `findLargestNumberDivisibleBy5` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the largest number in the array that is divisible by 5. If there are no numbers divisible by 5, return `0`. Call the function with `numbersArray` and print the `largestNumber` to the console.
